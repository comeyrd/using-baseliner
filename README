# Using Baseliner

This project is a simple example of the implementation of the Kernel Interface of Baseliner, to help developpers have an idea on how they can fit their kernel into the Baseliner format.

The source kernel is from a Cuda example in the [cuda-samples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples) git. Specifically [MatrixMul](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Samples/0_Introduction/matrixMul) example.
